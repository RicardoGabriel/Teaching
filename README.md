# Teaching Codes

Here you can find the code for my teaching projects.

* Folder [Teaching_R](https://github.com/RicardoGabriel/Research/tree/main/Teaching_R) displays my Tutorials for the course Computer-aided Statistical Analysis in R. I follow the book "An Introduction to Statistical Learning" (ISLR) that can be downloaded for free here: https://www.statlearning.com/. I draw on different online resources and present solutions for several of the exercises in the book with detailed coding instructions.

* Folder [Teaching_Macro_MATLAB](https://github.com/RicardoGabriel/Research/tree/main/Teaching_Macro_MATLAB) displays one example tutorial with an example of MATLAB code used to teach Macroeconomics at the graduate level.

* Folder [Historical_Wage_Phillips_Curves_Stata](https://github.com/RicardoGabriel/Research/tree/main/Historical_Wage_Phillips_Curves_Stata) presents the Stata code for my research project [Monetary Policy and the Wage Inflation-Unemployment Tradeoff](https://www.ricardoduquegabriel.com/publication/gabriel_2020_hwpc/).
